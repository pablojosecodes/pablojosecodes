Let's kick off our [exploration of Calculus]({{ 'posts/calculus' | relative_url }}) with a dive into limits.


## Tangent Lines and Rate of Change

Before we formally define limits, let's understand their conceptual grounding.

Welcome to my notes on Fundamental Concepts in Calculus, designed as a **short conceptual guide** for students and enthusiasts alike. These notes aim to demystify calculus, making it more approachable and understandable, especially for those who appreciate a visual and intuitive learning style. Since the emphasis is on the *concepts*, this guide is less authoritative and encompassing as my other posts, but should be helpful to build an intuition for Calculus regardless.

Please note that these materials assume some basic knowledge in algebra and pre-calculus. A visual and geometric approach is often emphasized, making complex concepts more tangible.

Here is the table of contents


## The Limit


> **Conceptually**, the limit of f(x) is L as x approaches a.
> 
> We write this as $$\underset{x \rightarrow a}{\text{lim}} f(x) = a$$

> **Definition of a limit**
> 
> The Limit of $f$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from above is $L$ if: 
>
> for every $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $0 < x - p < \delta$ , we have $\|f(x) - L\| < \epsilon$
> 
> We write this as $$\underset{x \rightarrow a}{\text{lim}} f(x) = a$$
