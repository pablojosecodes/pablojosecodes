### Graphs

**Graph Components**
- *Objects*: nodes, vertices (N)
- *Interactions*: Arcs, links, edges (E)
- *System*: graph, network (G(N,E))
**To define any graph**
- What are its nodes?
- What are its edges?
**Terminology/Types of Graphs**
- **Directed vs undirected**
	- Sample Directed: Twitter Followers
	- Sample Undircted: Facebook Friends
- **Degree/Grado** Number of adjacent nodes for a given node
- **Grado Medio**: Average degree of graph’s nodes. Represents the density of a graph.
- **Heterogeneous Graphs**: contains multiple types of nodes or links
	- **Bipartite graphs**: Nodes are divided into 2 categories and arcs go from one to another
- **Adjacency Matrix**
	- Not symmetric if graph is directed
	- Essentially, fill out a matrix $A$ where $A_{ij}$ is 1 if there is a link from node $i$ to $j$ and 0 if not
- **List of Edges**
	- List of the pairs of  connected nodes 
- **Adjacency List**
	- For each ndoe, indicate its neighbors (easy to search through)
- **Multigraph**
	- Can have parallel edges (ie adjacency matrix would have the numbers 2+, not just 1s)
- **Self-Edges**
	- Can have edge to itself
- **Connectivity**: more relations between all graph’s pairs of nodes
	- **Strongly Connected Graph**: Can travel to any vertex from any
	- **Weakly connected graph**: if would be strongly connected if directed edges were replaced with undirected ones.
**Node/Edge Attributes**
- Weight/Peso: frequency of communication between noes
- Centrality/Centralidad: position/importance in the graph
- Ranking: best friend, second best friend
- Type: friend, acquaintance
- Sign/Signo: friend/enemy, trusted/untrusted
