N.B. *This post is part of my efforts to allow for a more mainstream audience to comprehend the state of the art of AI research. It can be extremely difficult to know what the latest advances are, much less keep up with the most recent research. I talk more about this [here](/posts/papers=complicated/)*



Let's breakdown [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/hash/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Abstract.html)


# Stream Diffusion: 
**Graph Components**
- *Objects*: nodes, vertices (N)
- *Interactions*: Arcs, links, edges (E)
- *System*: graph, network (G(N,E))
**To define any graph**
- What are its nodes?
- What are its edges?
**Terminology/Types of Graphs**
- **Directed vs undirected**
	- Sample Directed: Twitter Followers
	- Sample Undircted: Facebook Friends
- **Degree/Grado** Number of adjacent nodes for a given node
- **Grado Medio**: Average degree of graph’s nodes. Represents the density of a graph.
- **Heterogeneous Graphs**: contains multiple types of nodes or links
	- **Bipartite graphs**: Nodes are divided into 2 categories and arcs go from one to another
- **Adjacency Matrix**
	- Not symmetric if graph is directed
	- Essentially, fill out a matrix $A$ where $A_{ij}$ is 1 if there is a link from node $i$ to $j$ and 0 if not
- **List of Edges**
	- List of the pairs of  connected nodes 
- **Adjacency List**
	- For each ndoe, indicate its neighbors (easy to search through)
- **Multigraph**
	- Can have parallel edges (ie adjacency matrix would have the numbers 2+, not just 1s)
- **Self-Edges**
	- Can have edge to itself
- **Connectivity**: more relations between all graph’s pairs of nodes
	- **Strongly Connected Graph**: Can travel to any vertex from any
	- **Weakly connected graph**: if would be strongly connected if directed edges were replaced with undirected ones.
**Node/Edge Attributes**
- Weight/Peso: frequency of communication between noes
- Centrality/Centralidad: position/importance in the graph
- Ranking: best friend, second best friend
- Type: friend, acquaintance
- Sign/Signo: friend/enemy, trusted/untrusted
