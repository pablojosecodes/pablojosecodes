Research papers are (generally) not written for you; if you had to determine a specific target audience for research papers, it would be the set of reviewers at whatever journal a given researcher submits to.

And it turns out that unless you're a PhD student or full-time researcher, you likely have a substantially different intellectual background concerning the material at hand than that set of peer reviewers does. 

Which makes sense. Science is about pushing the edges of knowledge forward- and most of the people consuming cutting-edge research papers are already well-versed in the jargon and paradigms of whatever field the paper discusses.

However, this makes keeping up or catching up with any field (especially fields like generative artificial intelligence models that seem to have a breakhrough every other day), especially difficult. 

I view this much in the same way that keeping up with local news in a foreign city that speaks a langauge foreign to you. Two pieces of complexity in this example are immediately apparent. First, there's the constant barrage of news you'd need to filter through- do you care about the sports section? Does that new gas station opening have an impact on your daily commute? Second, there's the trifling fact that the news is written in a language you don't speak.

In the context of recent AI breakthroughs, I'd only add a caveat to this metaphor; it just so happens, to extend the metaphor, that this foreign city has a few local events occuring which might have wide-ranging impacts on the rest of the world (say, they're building nukes).

All that to say, I do some paper breakdowns on this website.  You can find the pure paper breakdowns by checking out the ["breakdown" tag](/tags/breakdown) and more implementation heavy breakdowns at the ["implementation" tag](/tags/implementation).

This whole post has been a meandering ramble of me rationalizing the use they provide people, but really- I just like talking about recent papers.
