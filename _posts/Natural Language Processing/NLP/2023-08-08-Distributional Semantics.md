Welcome to my notes on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, inspired by a Master's course at the Polytechnic University of Madrid. These public notes are meant to be a resource for both current students and anyone interested in exploring the fascinating world of deep learning applied to language.

A familiarity with the basics of programming, particularly in Python, is also beneficial, as many examples and exercises will involve coding.

Some important pointers for those using these materials to learn or review:
