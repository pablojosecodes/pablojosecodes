    "content": "HeadingsH1 - headingH2 - headingWe already kow how to find area under curve (definite integral), but what about for other function types?  Intuition: example, $f(x,y)=x y, x = g(t), y = h(t) \\text{, for } a\\leq t \\leq b$          Intuitively, change in ds (super small arc length change) gets a rectangle / area using f(x,y)      Think of hte integral as the wall long curve up to the surface      Thus its the integral of f(x,y)s over time period t = a to t = b      $ds = \\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}$  since ds is the arc length      SO, we can represent the integral as                  $\\int ^{t=b}_{t=a} f(x,y) \\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}$  Since we’re integrating as a function of t, we should write f in terms of t          Can mutliply the square root by $\\frac{dt}{dt}$          Thus, the integral becomes $\\int ^{t=b}_{t=a} f(x,y) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\partial x}{dt}^2+ \\frac{\\partial y}{dt}^2}$ dt                          First term = the height- secon term, the changing arc                Formula for line integral                                                          $\\int ^{t=b}_{t=a} f(x,y) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\partial x}{dt}^2+ \\frac{\\partial y}{dt}^2}$  Given a scalar field $f$, parameterization $\\alpha$, and bounds $t_0$ and $t_1$, we can calculate the line entegral as follows:  Equation for line integral: $\\int _C f ds=\\int _{t_0}^{t_1}f(\\alpha (t))\\text{ }\\lvert \\lvert alpha’(t)\\rvert \\rvert ds$FILL In with intuitonLine Integrals in Vector FieldsTake a vector field F an a curve C wondering through the vector field.  Walk along the curve an at each step take the dot pooduct between          vector from the field F where you’re standing      displacement vetor assoicated with the next step you take along the curve        This is the line integral of F along C          Shorthand: $\\int_c F \\cdot dr$      More explicit notation: given a parameterization  $r(t)$ of $C$,                  $\\int_a^b F(r(t)) \\cdot r’(t) dt$                    Breaking it down                  $F$ the vector (force) field          $C$ curve through space          $r(t)$ vector-valued function parameterizing the curve $C$ in the range a ≤ t ≤ b          $r’(t)$ is the derivative of $r$, which represents the velocity vector of a particle whose position is given by $r(t)$ while $t$ increases at a constant rate          Think of $F(r(t)) \\cdot r’(t) dr$ as $dW$- a tiny amount of work done by the rofrce field $F$ on a particle moving along C                      Useful for: computing the work done by a force on a moving object  Difference between this an dline integration in a scalar field          Tiny step ds is now thought of as a vector, now a scale length      "

This likely means making blog posts that explain concepts that I review.For each video/concept  Watch the video  Rewrite content in my own words  (where practical) Look at practical exercises + ensure know how to solve  (where practical) Write out practical exerises + explanation of how to solve in my own words  Add link to page to the section below this  Create bullet points / flash cards for easy review/retention!!!!Sections with notes (links to Obsidian Pages)  Derivative  Exponentials  Implicit Differentiation  Limits + L’Hopitals + Epsilon Delta  Integrals  Taylor’s SeriesCalculus, RevisitedIt has been a great many years since I’ve formally studied Calculus- or any math at all for that matter. Perhaps that is why it was such a delight to revisit the material. Truly, I felt a great deal of positive nostalgia as I revisited this material.Calculus, at its essence, is the branch of mathematics concerned with change and motion.It all hinges on the concept of the derivative.DerivativeTo develop an intuitive understanding for the derivative, let’s imagine that you are traveling in a car down a road such that your position at any time is governed by d = f(t)Let’s additionally plot your velocity at any given time with the function v = g(t)The intuition behind this concept, velocity, is quite readily apparent, right? It’s just the speed at which you are going in the forward direction at any given time t.But wait. How is it possible to have a speed you are going at the speific moment in time t? t is an instant in time, and speed is, by definition measured over time.Well, the way we resolve this seeming paradox is to consider, not the instant t, but a time block around t that approaches 0. We denote this change in time as dt.Specific DerivativesNow that we understand the concept of t, let us develop some intuition for the common shorthands for calculating the derivatives to equations$x^2$$x^3$You may be noticing a a pattern. Indeed, whenever we consider x to any degree, we can rest assured that the dx’s past the first will disappear.In case I haven’t sufficiently convined you of this fact, let us just imagine that we have x^n where n is a huge number. Let us find the derivative.We know the derivative will be $x^n - (x+dx)^n$ , so let’s go ahead and calculate $(x+dx)^n$. We can start multiplying out all the factors, getting $x^n + (n-1)x^{n-1}dx + (n-2)x^{n-2}dx^2 + \\ldots$ but wait! Remeber what we said about dx! once we have dx with a power greater than 1, we can consider it neglibeble. And Thus, we can see that the derivative will be $x^n - x^n + (n-1)x^{n-1}dx$ which will equal $(n-1)x^{n-1}dx$. And just like that, we have our general equation for $\\frac{df}{dx}x^n = (n-1)x^{n-1}"
