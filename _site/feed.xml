      Welcome to my notes on Fundamental Concepts in Calculus, designed as a conceptual guide for students and enthusiasts alike. These notes aim to demystify calculus, making it more approachable and understandable, especially for those who appreciate a visual and intuitive learning style. Since the emphasis is on the concepts, this guide is less authoritative and encompassing as my other posts, but...

      Graphs

Graph Components

  Objects: nodes, vertices (N)
  Interactions: Arcs, links, edges (E)
  System: graph, network (G(N,E))
To define any graph
  What are its nodes?
  What are its edges?
Terminology/Types of Graphs
  Directed vs undirected
    
      Sample Directed: Twitter Followers
      Sample Undircted: Facebook Friends
    
  
  Degree/Grado Number of adjacent nodes for a given nod...
